# AutoAWT

### [[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9736959?source=authoralert) [[Project Page]](https://github.com/ohseokkwon/AutoAWT/)<br>

AutoAWT is a general-purpose wall thickness measurement algorithm for 3D atrial wall thickness measurements, which can be used using binary mask images generated by any segmentation software. This algorithm includes the detection of endocardial and epicardial and wall thickness measurement by the Laplace equation and Euler's method.

The code was written by [Oh-Seok Kwon](link) with support from [Hui-Nam Pak]().

# Getting Started

### Installation
- Dependencies
  - CUDA 10.0 ([download link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive)).

- Datasets repository
  - The sample datasets (2 CT and segmented 320 atrial wall binary mask images) for AutoAWT in [datasets/Phantom](/datasets/Phantom).

### Run
- You can build & run (Visual studio 2015).
```
Step 1. select directory of mask images (datasets/Phantom/masks_1).
Step 2. select directory of DCM (datasets/Phantom/ct)
```

- Derived results (in "Results" directory)
```
- WT-endo.plt : Calculated wall thickness from endocardium to epicardium
- WT(projected)-PatientID.plt : Wall thickness projected to surface mesh
- WT(projected)-PatientID.stl : surface mesh
- surface_mesh.stl : Reconstructed surface mesh
- Epi-Endo directory : Images labeled as endocardium, epicardium, and myocardium in binary images
   (pixel value 1: endocardium, 2: myocardium, 3: epicardium)
```
