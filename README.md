# AutoAWT

### [[Paper]](link) [[Project Page]](https://github.com/ohseokkwon/AutoAWT)<br>

AutoAWT is a general-purpose wall thickness measurement algorithm for 3D atrial wall thickness measurements, which can be used using binary mask images generated by any segmentation software. This algorithm includes the detection of endocardial and epicardial and wall thickness measurement by the Laplace equation and Euler's method.
